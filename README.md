# Project-VladimEEr
They said it couldn't be done. I laughed and said "You're probably right" 

Project VladimEEr is an attempt by yours truly to integrate the wonderful UI of Vladimir UI into the also wonderful Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition.
Making a patch for these two is not easy as EE changed aspects of the UI to suit its needs while Vlad did its own things as well
However, after figuring out what I needed to do I managed to get an almost completely functional integration of Vladimir UI into EE!

Now, I have had to make a sacrifice on both ends to make this happen:
In EE I have removed MQS because it was just impossible to get it to work with Vlad without some serious redswf editing. I never used MQS and I don't think every EE player does so its an alright loss
In Vlad I have disabled its meditation system because EE already has friendly meditation which is generally speaking better for EEs functions

Outside of that both sides have somewhat retained their functions to a reasonable degree. Do note the mod is in BETA atm so don't expect a super smooth experience

IMPORTANT NOTE: This mod requires EE Redux, this means that normal EE IS NOT SUPPORTED

Installation
You will require the files from EE, EE Redux and Vladimir UI but you do not need all of it. When you have downloaded those three mods delete the following
modW3EE
modReduxW3EE/content/scripts
modVladimirUI

Once you have done so download the latest version of this mod and place in your directory.
Regarding merging I do not know how stable this mod is compared to normal EE so do understand if your normal merges don't work anymore

Known Issues
Items aren't correctly sorted in the inventory
The adrenaline(now vigor) bar is white instead of red
The level and exp bar are showing even though EE does not use levels anymore (also extends to the map)
The skill menu has all the default skill slots still showing
The skill menu is missing some icons
Transitioning from inventory to stash directly rather than through the ring menu breaks things a bit
The meditation menu has some artifacts
Some items aren't positioned correctly in places like the radial menu
